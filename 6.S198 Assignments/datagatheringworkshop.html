            1.2 Downloading and Viewing Data
        </h1>

        <h2>
            What about the structure of this dataset might make it harder to feed into a machine learning 
            model? (Hint: is all the information in users.csv useful?)
        </h2>

        <p>
            The lack of consistency in some of the datapoints would make this difficult to run through a net.
            For example, in respect to the gender there's a lot of "unknowns." There are also a ton of ages
            that are left blank
        </p>

        <h2>
            Is this dataset a good fit for the task at hand? What problems could you think of that might 
            make this dataset not useful?
        </h2>

        <p>
            For the most part this dataset seems like it'd be a good indicator of whether some factors might
            make someone lean more towards one country than another. But things that aren't taken into account
            that I think are more important is the fact that none of these factors usually influence what 
            country an individual might lean towards. For example, usually the affordability of the country should be
            taken into account, or the prior search history of the user, or the time of year even.
        </p>


        <h1> 
            1.3 Data Processing and Kaggle kernels 
        </h1>

        <h2>
            Using the kernel provided as a starting point, build another data visualization or compute another 
            statistic that might be relevant for the dataset. Take a picture of the code that you write, and of
            any outputs and visualizations that you create.
        </h2>

        <p>
            Below a quick visualization we can do is check where people in the US want to travel the most (at least according
            to this dataset). It seems that they mostly like to stay at home, and travel internally. (ignoring the NDF which
            means there wasn't a booking)

        <h1> 4: Brainstorm data collection strategy for your project</h1>

        <p> We ended up putting together a sort of guideline for our project rather than a paragraph, with 
            everything from data collection to datasets:
