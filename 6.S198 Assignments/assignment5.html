        <h1> Problem 1.2: Changing the Model</h1>
        <h2> 1.2.1: Why does the Generator need the second FC layer to transform the shape [256] output of the first FC layer?</h2>
        <p> 
            The second layer is needed because it's impossible to reshape a size 100 vector into the 28x28x1 shape
            we'd need to create an mnist image. 28 times 28 is 784, and it's easy to see how to reshape between a 
            vector of size 784 to a tensor of size 28x28x1. 
        </p>
        <h2> 1.2.2: Submit screenshots of some reults </h2>

        <h2> 1.2.3: Can you say anything about the performance of the system's default fully connected model versus the performance of the convolutional model?</h2>
        <p>
            After playing around with them for a bit, it's clear that the convolutional model produces much nicer
            and faster results than simple fully connected layers.
        </p>

        <h1> Problem 1.3: Exploring with GAN Playground </h1>
        <h2> 1.3.1: Were any of your models able to generate any rasonable MNIST digits? If so, were any of your models able to generate all of the MNIST digist (0-9)?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not sure if it has anything to do with the computer I was using, but as much as I tried to change the
            parameters, I couldn't seem to get away from all of the generated examples looking the same way and not 
            coming close to forming a concrete image. They seemed to get stuck on examples such as the one below.
        </p>
        <h2> 1.3.2: What happened when the discriminator learning rate was greater than the generator learning rate? What about when the generator learning rate was greater than the discriminator learning rate?</h2>
        <p>
            Again, I'm not sure if it was a bug with my instance of using the website, but even when trying to follow the above question, I seemed to get stuck 
            with the generator producing the same-looking images:
