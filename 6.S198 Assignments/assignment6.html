        <h1> Problem 1: What is the reward scheme for FrozenLake?</h1>
        <h2> What is the reward scheme for FrozenLake? </h2>
        
        <p> It seems that the reward is 1 if the agent reaches the goal, and -1 or some other
            penalizing values if it falls into a hole</p>
        
        <h1> Problem 2 </h1>
        <h2> How big is the table used for Q-learning above? </h2>
        
        <p>
            Assuming that from every square you can move in four directions. For 16 squares, the table would
            be of size 16*4. 
        </p>

        <h1> Problem 3 </h1>
        <h2> Did the rewards improve over time? Why or why not? </h2>
        <p>
            Steadily the table begins to get populated with more rewards than 0s; I would take this 
            to be an improvement, or sign of it learning.
        </p>

        <h1> Problem 4 </h1>
        <h2> In the above code segment, we provided some values for the learning rate and discount 
            factor. Try different values for the learning rate. What do you observe?
        </h2>
        <p>
            As expected, a lower learning rate yielded less rewards, and vice versa. Changing the discount
            factor in a similar fashion resulted in the same behavior. I also tried increasing the episodes,
            which naturally made the process take longer, but seemed to yield a more accurate/useful table.
