        <h2> Visualizing convolutional neural networks </h2>
        <p> I went through the X Y and Z out of curiosity, and got pretty much what I expected, with the exception of X, which
            I honestly didn't know what to expect. For Y I honestly can't say what similarities it shares with 8, except 
            maybe the "pinching" off into different strands at the center. For Z I expected 2.

        <p> The system is surprisingly robust when it comes to random noise, likes these dots. It makes me wonder 
            if it was trained on such examples or it it's just that good at deducing features.

        <h2> Fast style transfer </h2>

        <img src = "Images/stata.jpg" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
        <p> Passing the image through the same filter multiple resulted in a notable loss of detail in the image, 
            as well as a notable increase in padding artifacts which took the form of a border (which I now realize
            I failed to capture in this screenshot). The image also seemed
            to become more pixelated every time.

        <p> Interestingly, the image becomes notably pixelated through the pass of two different filters, and 
            it seems that the styles don't mix very well either, as seen by the blurriness of the image.
