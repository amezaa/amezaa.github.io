        <h1> Problem 1: </h1>
        <h2> Visualizing convolutional neural networks </h2>
        <p> I went through the X Y and Z out of curiosity, and got pretty much what I expected, with the exception of X, which
            I honestly didn't know what to expect. For Y I honestly can't say what similarities it shares with 8, except 
            maybe the "pinching" off into different strands at the center. For Z I expected 2.

        <p> The system is surprisingly robust when it comes to random noise, likes these dots. It makes me wonder 
            if it was trained on such examples or it it's just that good at deducing features.

        <h2> Fast style transfer </h2>
        <p> Original image</p>
        <img src = "Images/stata.jpg" style='height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain'/>
        <p> Passing the image through the same filter multiple resulted in a notable loss of detail in the image, 
            as well as a notable increase in padding artifacts which took the form of a border (which I now realize
            I failed to capture in this screenshot). The image also seemed
            to become more pixelated every time.

        <p> Interestingly, the image becomes notably pixelated through the pass of two different filters, and 
            it seems that the styles don't mix very well either, as seen by the blurriness of the image.

        <h1> Problem 4: Building CNNs with code</h1>
        <h2> Do you have a hypothesis for why CIFAR-10 is so much harder to train on than Fashion MNIST and MNIST 
            (i.e. itâ€™s more difficult to achieve a 90%+ accuracy) while Fashion MNIST has similar training times to 
            MNIST (even though Fashion MNIST is more complex than MNIST)? 
        </h2>
        <p> 
            My initial guess would be that the images in CIFAR-10 are far more complex feature-wise than the MNIST 
            datasets. There's also the addition of color that we have to account for.that adds another few layers of
            complexity where images might overlap.
        </p>
        <h2> How does adding more convolutional layers relate to accuracy and training speed? Is there a point 
            at which adding more layers plateaus or even decreases the maximum accuracy you are able to achieve 
            with that model?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The training speed decreases due to the increased number of computations the computer has to make
            , but an increase of convolutional layers allows for more finely distinguishing of factors in the image
            and thus more accuracy (up to a certain point).

            not screenshots so that the graders can run your code if necessary).
