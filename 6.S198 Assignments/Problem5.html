    <!-- The script below runs a computation using a Tensor data
    structure from Tensorflow.js.  The computation
    runs on the computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit),
    which is much faster than running on the CPU.  The speed
    difference is irrelevant for this tiny example, but will
    become critical for compute-intense applications like
    training neural networks. -->
